                What is a Scatter Plot?<br>
                A scatter plot is a graph that uses dots to represent individual data points on a two-dimensional plane.<br>
                Each dot represents a data point, and the position of the dot is determined by two variables, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.<br>
                Scatter plots are useful for showing correlations or relationships between two variables.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Key Characteristics of Scatter Plots:<br>
                • Each data point is represented by a dot.<br>
                • The position of the dot corresponds to values on the x and y axes.<br>
                • Scatter plots are used to show relationships or correlations between two variables.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Components of a Scatter Plot:<br>
                • Vertical Axis (Y-Axis) – Represents one numerical variable.<br>
                • Horizontal Axis (X-Axis) – Represents another numerical variable.<br>
                • Dots – Each dot represents a data point.<br>
                • Title – Provides insight into the purpose of the plot.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Types of Scatter Plots:<br>
                1. Simple Scatter Plot:<br>
                   A basic scatter plot showing data points.<br>
                2. Bubble Plot:<br>
                   A variation of the scatter plot where each data point is represented by a bubble.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Properties of Scatter Plots:<br>
                • Each data point is represented by a dot.<br>
                • The position of the dots is determined by the values of the two variables.<br>
                • Scatter plots can show trends, correlations, and clusters in data.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uses of Scatter Plots:<br>
                Scatter plots are used to identify relationships between two variables, detect trends, and highlight clusters or outliers.<br>
                They are effective for visualizing correlations, regression analysis, and distribution.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real-Life Applications:<br>
                • Analyzing the correlation between hours of study and exam scores.<br>
                • Showing the relationship between advertising budget and sales.<br>
                • Displaying the distribution of ages in a population.<br>

                Advantages & Disadvantages of Scatter Plots:<br>
                Advantages:<br>
                • Great for showing correlations and relationships.<br>
                • Helps identify trends, clusters, and outliers.<br>
                • Simple and effective for comparing two variables.<br>
                Disadvantages:<br>
                • Can become cluttered with too many data points.<br>
                • Not suitable for categorical data.<br>

                1. Choose a Title – e.g., "Height vs Weight."<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                2. Draw Axes – Horizontal (X-axis) and Vertical (Y-axis).<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                3. Label Axes – X-axis: Height; Y-axis: Weight.<br>
