                What is a Line Chart?<br>
                A line chart, also known as a line graph, is a visual representation of data using points connected by straight lines.<br>
                This type of chart is useful for showing trends over time or continuous data.<br>
                Line charts display the relationship between two variables, where one is typically the time on the x-axis, and the other variable is represented on the y-axis.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Key Characteristics of Line Charts:<br>
                • They show data points connected by a line to display trends.<br>
                • They are especially effective for visualizing continuous data over time.<br>
                • The x-axis usually represents time, and the y-axis represents numerical values.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Components of a Line Chart:<br>
                • Vertical Axis (Y-Axis) – Represents numerical values.<br>
                • Horizontal Axis (X-Axis) – Represents time or other continuous data.<br>
                • Title – Provides insight into the purpose of the chart.<br>
                • Data Points – Each point represents a data value.<br>
                • Line – Connects data points to show the trend.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Types of Line Charts:<br>
                1. Simple Line Chart:<br>
                   A single line is drawn to represent one data series.<br>
                2. Multiple Line Chart:<br>
                   Multiple lines are drawn to compare different data series.<br>
                3. Stacked Line Chart:<br>
                   Displays multiple data series stacked on top of each other.<br>
                4. Dot Plot:<br>
                   Points are plotted with markers, not connected by a line.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Properties of Line Charts:<br>
                • Data points are connected by straight lines.<br>
                • The x-axis typically represents time or continuous intervals.<br>
                • The y-axis represents values corresponding to each data point.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uses of Line Charts:<br>
                Line charts are commonly used to track changes over time, compare multiple variables, or illustrate trends.<br>
                They are particularly useful for data that has a clear sequence, like stock prices, weather patterns, or sales data.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real-Life Applications:<br>
                • Tracking stock prices over time.<br>
                • Showing changes in temperature over a day or year.<br>
                • Displaying sales trends for a business.<br>

                Advantages & Disadvantages of Line Charts:<br>
                Advantages:<br>
                • Clearly displays trends and patterns over time.<br>
                • Makes it easy to compare multiple data sets.<br>
                • Ideal for continuous data.<br>
                Disadvantages:<br>
                • Can be difficult to interpret with too many lines.<br>
                • Less effective for comparing discrete data points.<br>

                Drawing a Line Chart – Step by Step:<br>
                Example data: January: 10, February: 15, March: 30, April: 50.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                1. Choose a Title – e.g., "Number of Sales Over Time."<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                2. Draw Axes – Horizontal (X-axis) and Vertical (Y-axis).<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                3. Label Axes – X-axis: Months; Y-axis: Sales numbers.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                4. Set a Scale – Choose appropriate intervals for the vertical axis (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.).<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                5. Plot Data Points – Mark each month's sales on the chart.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                6. Draw a Line – Connect the points to show the trend.<br>
            </p>
